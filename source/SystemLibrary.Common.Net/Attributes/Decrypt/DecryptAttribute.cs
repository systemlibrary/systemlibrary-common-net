/// Mark a property as the Decrypted value of an Encrypted Configuration Property
/// <para>The property marked must be Public, Instance, Get and Set.</para>
/// <para>This attribute goes hand in hand with Config class, when a Config class is created it looks for which properties has this attribute and decrypts accordingly</para>
/// To decrypt, properties must be encrypted through Encrypt() extension in this library that takes no Key/IV, but the "default" you've specified by configuration/convention. Read more in StringExtensions.Encrypt method how to encrypt.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The PropertyName must be a property within the same class that this attribute was used, and class must inherit Config to work automatically
/// <para>This class attribute exists to read Config Properties that are public get;set;, but feel free to use Decrypt attribute yourself as it is not subject for breaking changes in near future</para>
/// The decryption occurs only once for the app life time, at the creation of the Configuration class
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// apiConfig.json:
/// <code>
/// {
///    token: "An encrypted value of the token, store it safely in git as it is encrypted by a key/IV only you know!"

///    public string Token {get;set;} //Encrypted value...
